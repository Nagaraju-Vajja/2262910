      <p>Indian film history has constantly been evolving over time, and while it used to produce a breakout film once
         in a blue moon, this has recently changed. Blockbusters like Bahubali, RRR, and K.G.F. 
         have propelled Indian cinema to new heights of acclaim and attention. In particular, 
         RRR has become a global phenomenon by winning a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song and
          is nominated for the Academy Award in the same category. While fans anticipate more films like these,
           the director Prashanth Neel has one scheduled for release in 2023.

        Salaar is an upcoming Tollywood action film starring Prabhas, 
        Prithviraj Sukumaran, Shruti Haasan, and Jagapathi Babu.
         The film was announced in December 2020, with filming beginning in 2021, 
         and despite a few setbacks, it will hit theaters this year. With rumors circulating regarding 
         the film's possible connection to the K.G.F universe, audiences across India are more excited than 
         ever to witness the action thriller. Here's everything we know about the upcoming film Salaar.</p>
